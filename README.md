# Push_swap

## Summary
In the push_swap project at 42, we tackled the challenge of sorting a stack of numbers using a limited set of operations. Through this project, I gained valuable skills in implementing and optimizing efficient sorting algorithms, with a focus on cost calculation to minimize the total number of operations.

## Implementation
My approach was to calculate the cost of each operation and optimize the algorithm to minimize the total number of operations required to sort the stack. This approach proved to be efficient enough, achieving a score of 5/5 on the performance test with 100 numbers and a score of 4/5 with 500 numbers.

## Available Moves

sa: Swap A - swap the first two numbers in stack A.

sb: Swap B - swap the first two numbers in stack B.

ss: Swap A and B - perform sa and sb simultaneously.

pa: Push A - move the first number from stack B to stack A.

pb: Push B - move the first number from stack A to stack B.

ra: Rotate A - rotate all numbers in stack A upwards.

rb: Rotate B - rotate all numbers in stack B upwards.


rr: Rotate A and B - perform ra and rb simultaneously.

rra: Reverse Rotate A - rotate all numbers in stack A downwards.

rrb: Reverse Rotate B - rotate all numbers in stack B downwards.

rrr: Reverse Rotate A and B - perform rra and rrb simultaneously.
